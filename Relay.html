    <div class="overview">
      <p>A relay is very <em> powerful, useful and common component</em> in 12
        automotive electronics.  A relay is essentially a
        <span style="text-decoration: underline;">switch</span>, the switch
        allows higher amperage to pass through the circuit and takes the
        stress off the user operated switch inside the vehicle.  Utilizing relays
        when adding accessories will not only greatly increase the safety factor
        of your wiring, but as you become accustomed to their use they will make
        the wiring job go much smoother.

    <p> The pictures below were retreived from various automotive forums on the
      internet.  These are just some examples of how a relay can be used.  These
      examples were published by unknown sources, but are representative of the
      proper use and wiring of a relay in typical 12v automotive use.
